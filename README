PHP/Javascript/SQL Database Search Front End
========================================

Description: 

This repository contains the files for a database search front-end my writers use. The back-end database is SQL, and I��ve written a PHP script with JQuery plugins to provide a method for running keyword searches. Try doing a search yourself -- I suggest common, but not too common, words like ��vacation�� or ��nutrition,�� as I��ve coded the script not to return results in cases where there are over 100. 



Files Worth Peeking At:

/TEPS/index4.php -- This is the main PHP file where all the magic happens. By magic, I mean interface calls to the database and simple GUI design. If you're looking for functionality, you've come to the right place. If you're looking for CSS / <div> wizardry, then peek at the Portfolio repository instead :)
